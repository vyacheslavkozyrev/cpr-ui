# Data Model â€” CPR

This document describes the initial PostgreSQL schema for the CPR platform. Keep the design simple and extensible; prefer clarity over premature optimization. Use UUID primary keys and sensible indexes for queries described in the vision.

Conventions
- PK: uuid (use gen_random_uuid() / uuid_generate_v4())
- Timestamps: timestamptz with timezone
- Soft delete: boolean "is_deleted" + deleted_at when needed
- Auditing: audit_logs table for important write actions
- JSON: use jsonb for flexible snapshots and tags
- Concurrency: add a row_version bigint or use xmin for optimistic concurrency

  - Consider composite indexes for common query patterns (e.g., (to_user_id, created_at) for listing recent feedback).

## NOTES

### Data retention and privacy
- Add a configurable retention policy table or set retention via a background job that marks rows as soft-deleted and eventually purges per legal requirements.
- For anonymous feedback, store a separate pseudonymization key or redact `from_user_id` where required, while keeping an immutable audit entry for moderation actions.
- Use soft-delete (is_deleted + deleted_at) as first step; permanently purge after retention window using scheduled jobs.
- Ensure exports and deletion operations are auditable in `audit_logs` with references to affected records and actor.
- Encrypt backups and restrict access to production databases; ensure DEV copies are scrubbed of PII.

### Migrations and EF Core
- Use EF Core migrations (dotnet-ef) in the Infrastructure project; keep migrations small and reviewable.
- Keep seed data minimal: an admin user, a sample manager and sample employees for local dev; do not seed production data.
- Use a separate schema (e.g., public) and avoid cross-schema complexity initially.
- Adopt migration checks in CI (e.g., ensure migrations build and can be applied to a disposable DB) before merging schema changes.
- Store migration history in the database using EF Core's __EFMigrationsHistory table; treat migrations as code that must be reviewed in PRs.

## TABLE RELATIONSHIPS (ER Diagram)

Below is a compact ASCII ER-style diagram showing primary relationships between the main tables. Use it as a quick reference when creating DDL, migrations or entity models.

```
[users] <--- referenced by created_by/modified_by/deleted_by across most tables
   |
   +--< users.id = employees.user_id

[departments]           [locations]            [positions]
    |                       |                      |
    +--< departments.id   +--< locations.id      +--< positions.id
           ^                     ^                    |
           |                     |                    +--< position_to_skill.position_id
           |                     |                    |
        employees               projects             |
        [employees]               |  \                |
        id                          |   \              +--< position_to_skill.skill_id --> [skills] --> [skill_levels]
        |-- department_id ----------    \              |
        |-- location_id ----------       +--< project_teams.project_id
        |-- position_id -------------        |
        |-- report_to (self)                +--< project_teams.employee_id --> [employees]
        |
        +--< employee_to_skill.employee_id --> [skills]

[projects]
  |-- owner_id --> employees.id
  |-- sponsor_id --> employees.id
  +--< project_teams.project_id --> project_roles

[project_roles]
  |-- position_id --> positions.id

[goals]
  |-- employee_id --> employees.id
  +--< goal_tasks.goal_id
  +--< feedback.goal_id

[goal_tasks] -- simple child records for goals

[feedback]
  |-- goal_id --> goals.id
  |-- project_id --> projects.id (optional)
  |-- project_role_id --> project_roles.id (optional)
  |-- from_employee_id --> employees.id
  |-- to_employee_id --> employees.id

[position_to_skill] maps positions -> skills -> skill_levels (target)
[employee_to_skill] maps employees -> skills (observed/target)

[audit_logs] references users(actor_id) and records target_type/target_id for append-only audit trail

Legend:
- Arrow direction shows FK: source_column --> referenced_table.column
- Tables not shown in full are still part of the model (skill_categories, career_paths, career_tracks, etc.) and link to the primary tables above.
- created_by / modified_by / deleted_by typically reference `users(id)` across the schema.
- Soft-delete fields (is_deleted, deleted_at) exist on most tables; consider partial indexes WHERE is_deleted = false for active-row queries.
