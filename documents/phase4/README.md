# Phase 4: Goals Management System

## Overview

Phase 4 implements a comprehensive goals management system for individual employees, focusing on personal goal setting, task breakdown, progress tracking, and skills alignment.

## Key Features

- Task-based goal breakdown with subtask management
- Progress tracking and status management
- Skills integration and alignment
- Dashboard integration with statistics and trends
- Manager oversight capabilities

## Scope

- **Individual Focus**: Goals are personal to each employee (no hierarchy or collaboration)

3. **UI Components**: Reusable goal and task components
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive MSW mocking and component tests
5. **Integration**: Dashboard widget updates and navigation
